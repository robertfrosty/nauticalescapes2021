				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>Ever since we met back in 2016, we have shared the same passion for many things. Music, boating, and certainly our 5 children. Over the past 5 years our go-to "Date Night" would be spent enjoying live music at many different venues, our favourite genre being The Blues. Every year (Covid-19 Permitting) we would go to The Big Blues Bender in Las Vegas, NV.When we first met, Brian owned a 46' Uniflite Power Yacht. It became quite clear that retiring and living on a boat was something that we were going to aim for. After some discussion about achieving this goal, we decided that the Uniflite would not be economical or safe for the 2 of us to travel in. So we started the search for our new boat. After alot of research we found our baby, A Mainship 400 which we aptly named "Our Song". In 2019 we found ourselves literally taking the plunge, after getting married on our new boat out in Lake Erie with family and close friends. Over the last couple of years we have done everything to set ourselves up with the goal of retiring on "Our Song" in 2021. Our dream has now come to fruition </p>

				<h2>Our Dreams</h2>
				<p>Since starting on the adventure of our lifetime, we've often thought about sharing our story and our life with family, friends and anyone interested in living aboard and the lifestyle that comes with it. We also would like to have the ability for people to join us and experience care-free living aboard. In the future, we would love to start offering a variety of services and one-day vacation packages, or 'Daycations'. Can you imagine a relaxing Thai massage aboard our vessel, listening to live music, then enjoy a lovely meal, ending your day with a sunset cruise? Our vision for a Daycation would include: Have an artist join us for live music, provide a Massage from a certified Thai-Massage Therapist or just a good spot to drop-a-line, and a nice sunset cruise to end the day. As of right now, these ideas are still under contruction. If you are interested in learning more, or have any questions, please feel free to explore our website to find out more.</p>
